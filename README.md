# Dogs-Vs-Cats
The goal is to write an algorithm that classifies whether the input image contains a Cat or a Dog.


# Description
This repository contains the notebooks that utilize the Dogs Vs. Cats dataset available at the Kaggle website under the Competitions Tab. Each Notebook contains similar data processing and visualization techniques while the machine learning model used is different for each Notebook.

# Note
Each Jupyter Notebook has the Kaggle Score included in its name. The Notebooks can also be found on my Kaggle Account under the Kernels Tab. https://www.kaggle.com/thedataspartan
